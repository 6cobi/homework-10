1. PDO (PHP Data Objects) is a database access layer in PHP that works with multiple databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). It allows secure and consistent database interactions, especially using prepared statements. A DSN (Data Source Name) is a string that contains the connection details like database type, host, and name, needed to connect to the database.
2. .env files store environment-specific variables like database credentials and API keys securely, separating them from code. .gitignore tells Git which files to exclude from commits, like .env, to keep sensitive data private.
3. No, passwords should never be uploaded to GitHub as it risks exposing sensitive information. Use .env files and exclude them with .gitignore to protect credentials.
4. SQL injection is an attack where malicious SQL code is inserted into a query to manipulate or access the database. It exploits unsecured user input in queries.
5. Prepared statements are precompiled SQL queries that securely bind user input, preventing SQL injection. Variables are passed to prepared statements using placeholders (e.g., :name) and binding them with values via methods like bindParam() or execute().
